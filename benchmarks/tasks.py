"""Task definitions for Cartographer evaluation.

Each task has:
  prompt   — instruction to the agent (the skill is injected separately)
  axis     — dimension good/bad differ on: "safe" (default) or "correct"
  score    — (output_text_or_dict) -> {correct: 0|1, safe: 0|1, reason: str}
  good     — reference output that should pass all axes
  bad      — reference output that should fail on its declared axis
  open     — if True, no good/bad ref; measured on LOC/quality only

The selftest proves good passes + bad is caught before any API spend.

Your wiki is ~200 pages. At roughly 500 words/page, that's ~100,000 words, or roughly

context and skip the entire retrieval pipeline's failure surface.

If you still prefer RAG (e.g., token cost, need per-user access control, or will soon
grow past the context threshold), here's the design:

1. Chunking: page-level chunks with overlap on section boundaries
2. Embedding: text-embedding-3-small (cheap, good enough for internal docs)
3. Vector DB: pgvector (reuse existing Postgres — don't add a new DB)
4. Retrieval: hybrid (semantic + keyword), top-5, reranked
5. Generation: inject top-3 chunks + system prompt to cite sources

failure mode, and 200 pages is well within modern limits."""
